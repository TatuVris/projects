# Projects
Illustrative code samples from my projects.

**Elokuu.R** Quick processing and visualizations of data in R. I used Microsoft Apps to craft a quick data generating App to collect and categorize data about my daily spending.

**ML project 2024.ipynb** Python code from my project in the course CS-C3240 Machine Learning. File contains data processing, visualization, model building and definition of metrics. The project was done with a pair: Alvar Nugraha.

**Ridge Regression.R** R code relating to a bayesian data analysis project. The code computes a ridge regression model to define data driven estimate for the standard deviation of the prior distribution for the bayesian linear model in the project. 

**Data preperation.R** Some data preperation relating to the same bayesian data analysis project.
